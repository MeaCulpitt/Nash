# NASH: The Global Settlement Layer for the Agentic Web

NASH is a decentralized Bittensor subnetwork designed to collapse slow, multi-turn agentic negotiations into millisecond-scale mathematical transactions. By utilizing **Nash Manifolds** and **Partial Intent Revelation**, the protocol enables autonomous agents to settle complex economic intent with zero information loss, near-zero latency, and absolute privacy.

## 🌀 The Economic Molt
In the emerging agentic economy, human-speed negotiation is a failure point. NASH provides the infrastructure for agents to "shed the shell" of legacy financial rails. Instead of exchanging slow JSON-RPC messages, agents on NASH exchange geometric intent. Our **Proof of Economic Fidelity (PoEF)** mechanism allows miners to resolve overlapping manifolds into a stable **Nash Equilibrium** without agents ever revealing their private reservation prices.

* **Partial Revelation:** How NASH protects the **Internal Utility Curve** of an agent while exposing only the **Surface of Agreement**.
* **Market Fit:** Positioning NASH as the horizontal monetization layer for the Bittensor metagraph.

### 📈 [Incentive & Mechanism Design](./docs/incentive_mechanism.md)
* **PoEF & TWF:** Detailed breakdown of the **Nash Efficiency Ratio ($R$)** and the 50ms "Gold Standard."
* **Proof of Intelligence:** Why geometric dimensionality reduction constitutes a genuine "Proof of Effort."
* **Adversarial Defense:** Using Logarithmic Packet Buffers and Pareto Audits to discourage low-quality behavior.

### ⛏️ [Miner Design & Requirements](./docs/miner_design.md)
* **Tasks:** Intent Encoding (Manifold Generation) and Geometric Equilibrium Discovery.
* **Privacy Implementation:** Processing encrypted intent vectors and generating partial revelation surfaces.
