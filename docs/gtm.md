# Nash Go-To-Market Strategy

## 1. Initial Target Users & Use Cases

### A. The "Task Routing" Pilot (SN62: Ridges)
* **Target:** Autonomous software engineering agents.
* **The Use Case:** Instead of a 10-second negotiation to hire sub-agents, orchestrators emit a Nash Manifold representing budget and deadline, settling the "hire" in <50ms.

### B. The "Burst Compute" Auction (SN27: Nodexo)
* **Target:** GPU miners and cloud-renters.
* **The Use Case:** Real-time spot markets for GPU power. The trade clears at the exact Nash Equilibrium price.

## 2. Distribution & Growth Channels
* **The "Nash-Wrap" SDK:** A Python library allowing any subnet owner to wrap their synapses with a single decorator for instant speed gains.
* **The "Manifold Marketplace" UI:** A dashboard visualizing the "Economic Heatmap" of the network.

## 3. Incentives for Early Participation

### A. For Miners: The "Genesis Fidelity" Multiplier
* 2x Emission Multiplier for the first 90 days for miners who open-source their manifold architectures.

### B. For Validators: The "Organic Traffic" Bounty
* Validators who successfully route organic trades from partner subnets receive an Incentive Weight boost.

### C. For Partner Subnets
* Adoption partners receive "Cross-Chain Credits," giving their agents preferred priority on the Nash network.
