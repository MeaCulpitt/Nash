# Nash Subnet: Go-To-Market Strategy

### Initial Target Users & Use Cases
Nash follows a "B2B Infrastructure" model, targeting specific agents and subnets that require high-frequency, autonomous decision-making.

* **Early Adopter: Compute Marketplaces (SN1, SN27, SN64):** Subnets like Chutes or Targon provide raw compute. Their agents currently use static pricing or slow negotiations. Nash acts as their "Trade API," allowing these agents to bid for and secure GPU spot-prices in milliseconds.
* **Pilot Partner: AI Agent Launchpads:** Projects focused on agentic economies (like Creator.Bid) need a backend for their agents to interact. Nash provides the settlement layer for these agents to "hire" one another for micro-tasks.
* **Anchor Use Case: Cross-Subnet Arbitrage:** Strategic miners can use Nash to identify price discrepancies between different resource providers on Bittensor, using the 50ms settlement speed to execute arbitrage trades that were previously impossible.

### Distribution & Growth Channels
Growth is driven by integrating Nash into the "daily workflow" of the Bittensor ecosystem.

1.  **Integrations (The "Wrapper" Strategy):** By building easy-to-use Python wrappers (e.g., `nash-settle-lib`), we allow any subnet owner to add "Instant Negotiation" to their miner/validator code with just three lines of code.
2.  **Validator Partnerships:** We will partner with large-scale validators (e.g., Foundry, Opentensor, Taostats) to demonstrate how Nash improves the "Utility Value" of the subnets they support, thereby encouraging them to delegate stake to Nash.
3.  **The Flywheel Effect:** As more subnets use Nash for settlement, the "Manifold Library" grows. This increases the accuracy of our miners, which in turn attracts more agents, creating a virtuous cycle of liquidity and emissions.

### Incentives for Early Participation
Bootstrapping a two-sided market requires aggressive early-stage incentives for both the "Supply" (Miners) and the "Trust" (Validators).

* **Miners (The "Alpha" Boost):** During the initial 4-month immunity period, we will prioritize **Fidelity Rewards**. This allows early miners to earn high TAO emissions by simply perfecting their "Manifold Compression" models, even before the transaction volume from agents peaks.
* **Validators (Governance & Dividends):** Early validators on Nash gain outsized influence in setting the "Economic Parameters" (the weights of the Nash Efficiency Ratio). As the subnet moves toward the dTAO (Dynamic TAO) model, early stakers in Nash's Alpha token stand to gain from the "Inflow-based" emission increases.
* **Users (Zero-Fee Entry):** For the first six months, Nash will operate with zero transaction fees for external agents. This lowers the barrier to entry, encouraging developers to migrate their agent negotiation logic from expensive LLM calls to the Nash Manifold system.
