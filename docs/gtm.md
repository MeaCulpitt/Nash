## Go-To-Market Strategy

## Overview

NASH needs three constituencies to succeed: **subnets** (who provide liquidity), **miners** (who find equilibria), and **validators** (who run the mechanism). Our GTM strategy addresses each.

---

## Initial Target Users & Use Cases

### Priority Subnets

| Subnet | Use Case | Priority | Why |
|--------|----------|----------|-----|
| **SN64 (Chutes)** | Inference job routing | High | GPU demand, time-sensitive |
| **SN27 (Nodexo)** | GPU capacity allocation | High | Supply side, needs customers |
| **SN12 (ComputeHorde)** | GPU compute for validation | Medium | Flexible demand |
| **SN62 (Ridges)** | Autonomous AI coding agents | Low | Complementary |

### Early Validator Targets

- Root network validators with cross-subnet visibility
- Existing subnet validators looking for alpha
- Community members passionate about DeFi/mechanism design

---

## Distribution & Growth Channels

### 1. Direct Subnet Partnerships

**Strategy:** Pitch directly to subnet teams.

**Outreach:**
- Identify subnets with resource trading needs
- Show value with custom use case analysis
- Offer free integration support

**Messaging:** *"Want to reduce your GPU costs by 15%? NASH finds optimal compute deals automatically."*

### 2. Bittensor Ecosystem

**Channels:** Discord (#subnets, #validators), Telegram groups, GitHub discussions, TAO.app subnet listings

**Content:** Technical deep-dives, Tutorial videos, Integration guides

### 3. Developer SDK

Ship Python SDK first with example code for compute settlement requests.
