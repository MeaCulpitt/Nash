# NASH Validator Design: The Equilibrium Auditor

## 1. Scoring and Evaluation Methodology
The NASH Validator utilizes a multi-stage auditing process to ensure that miner proposals are not just mathematically possible, but are the most efficient resolutions available for a given economic intent.

### A. The Pareto Audit (Equilibrium Verification)
The validator’s primary task is to verify if a miner’s submitted coordinate exists on the **Pareto Frontier**. 
* **Mechanism:** The validator runs a high-speed, local baseline simulation of the intent manifold. 
* **Scoring:** If a miner submits a solution that is Pareto-dominated by another miner’s solution or the validator’s own baseline, the miner’s **Quality Score** is penalised. Only solutions that represent a genuine Nash Equilibrium receive full credit.

### B. Proof of Marginal Utility (PMU) Weighting
To prevent the network from over-optimizing for "easy" trades, the validator applies a dynamic **PMU Multiplier**.
* **Methodology:** The validator tracks the frequency of similar intent-type submissions across the epoch.
* **Scoring:** High-frequency, low-complexity trades (e.g., standard currency pairs) receive a decaying multiplier. Unique, high-complexity trades (e.g., multi-modal industrial assets) receive a boost, rewarding miners for discovering "Economic Alpha."

### C. Time-Weighted Fidelity (TWF) Calculation
The validator maintains a rolling "Trust Ledger" for every UID in the metagraph.
* **Methodology:** The **TWF** is calculated as a decaying average of a miner's accuracy and latency over the last 1,000 challenges.
* **Impact:** This creates a "Reputation Floor." A miner with a high-quality solution but a low TWF will receive fewer emissions than a veteran miner with consistent, long-term performance.

## 2. Evaluation Cadence
NASH operates on a **High-Frequency Asynchronous Cycle** to ensure the marketplace reflects real-time economic shifts.

* **Challenge Generation (Block-Level):** A new economic challenge is generated every block (~12 seconds). Validators broadcast these challenges to the top 256 miners.
* **Response Window (200ms):** Miners must submit their Equilibrium Proposals within a strict 200ms window. Submissions received after this window are discarded to maintain market liquidity.
* **Epoch-Based Settlement:** While scoring happens per challenge, final weight setting on the subtensor occurs at the end of each **Epoch (360 blocks)**. This allows the validator to aggregate the **TWF** and **PMU** metrics over a statistically significant sample size.
* **Latent Sampling (Audit Phase):** Periodically, the validator will issue "Salted Challenges"—tasks with known solutions—to detect if miners are colluding or using pre-computed look-up tables.

## 3. Validator Incentive Alignment
In the NASH ecosystem, the validator's success is tied directly to the health and accuracy of the marketplace.

* **V-Trust and Dividends:** Validators are rewarded based on their **V-Trust** score. If a validator’s scoring deviates significantly from the consensus of other high-stake validators (e.g., by favoring certain miners or failing to catch poor solutions), their dividends are reduced.
* **The Accuracy-Latency Tradeoff:** Validators are incentivized to maintain elite infrastructure. If a validator’s own baseline simulation is too slow, they cannot accurately judge the 200ms response window of miners, leading to a loss of consensus and stake-weight.
* **Market-Making Rewards:** Validators earn a portion of the "Equilibrium Spread"—a synthetic fee generated by the volume of successfully matched economic intents—aligning their profit motive with the total economic utility of the subnet.
