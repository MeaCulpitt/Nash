# NASH: The Global Settlement Layer for the Agentic Web

![NASH Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeaCulpitt/Nash/main/docs/assets/banner.png)

NASH is a decentralized Bittensor subnetwork designed to collapse slow, multi-turn agentic negotiations into millisecond-scale mathematical transactions. By utilizing **Nash Manifolds**, the protocol enables autonomous agents to settle complex economic intent with zero information loss and near-zero latency.

## 🌀 The Economic Molt
In the emerging agentic economy, human-speed negotiation is a failure point. NASH provides the infrastructure for agents to "shed the shell" of legacy financial rails. Instead of exchanging JSON-RPC messages, agents on NASH exchange geometric intent, resolving overlapping manifolds into a stable **Nash Equilibrium** at machine-speed.

## 📚 Technical Documentation

Explore the core components of the NASH protocol:

### 💼 [Business Logic & Market Rationale](./docs/business_logic.md)
* **The Problem:** Solving the "Dialogue Bottleneck" in machine-to-machine trade.
* **The Moat:** Why geometric settlement is superior to centralized AI orchestrators.
* **The Vision:** Positioning NASH as the horizontal monetization layer for the entire Bittensor metagraph.

### 📈 [Incentive & Mechanism Design](./docs/incentive_mechanism.md)
* **Proof of Economic Fidelity (PoEF):** Our unique consensus mechanism that rewards structural accuracy and speed.
* **Time-Weighted Fidelity (TWF):** A reward-decay logic that enforces a 50ms "Gold Standard" for all settlements.
* **Dynamic TAO Integration:** How NASH aligns miner/validator incentives through dTAO.

### ⛏️ [Miner Design & Requirements](./docs/miner_design.md)
* **Tasks:** Intent Encoding (Manifold Generation) and Equilibrium Discovery.
* **Performance:** Detailed benchmarks for hitting sub-100ms TWF targets using high-bandwidth memory (HBM3).
* **Input/Output:** Specification for the high-density binary serialization format used in NASH Synapses.

### 🛡️ [Validator Design & Auditing](./docs/validator_design.md)
* **Scoring:** Detail on Latent Sampling and Pareto Audits to ensure "Proof of Intelligence."
* **Anti-Adversarial Logic:** Mechanisms to prevent weight-copying and manifold hallucination.
* **Cadence:** The block-by-block synthetic challenge cycle and tempo-based weight updates.

### 🚀 [Go-To-Market Strategy](./docs/go_to_market.md)
* **Anchor Subnets:** Integration plans for SN62 (Ridges), SN27 (Nodexo), and SN64 (Chutes).
* **Growth:** Utilizing the NASH SDK to create a developer-led integration flywheel.
* **Bootstrapping:** Early-participation multipliers for the first wave of "Molt" miners.
