# NASH Go-To-Market Strategy: Powering the Economic Molt

## 1. Initial Target Users & Use Cases
NASH is positioned as the "Financial Nervous System" for the emerging agentic economy. Our initial focus is on capturing high-frequency, machine-to-machine transactions where human-speed negotiation is a failure point.

### Early Adopters & Pilot Partners
We have identified three "Anchor Subnets" within the Bittensor ecosystem that serve as the ideal sandbox for NASH integration:
* **SN62 (Ridges):** Enabling instant settlement for agentic micro-task hiring and task routing.
* **SN27 (Nodexo):** Facilitating millisecond-scale clearance for GPU spot auctions and high-frequency resource allocation.
* **SN64 (Chutes):** Providing the bidding infrastructure for ultra-low-latency, hardware-specific inference tasks.

### Anchor Use Cases
* **High-Frequency Resource Swaps:** Real-time exchange of compute for storage between autonomous subnets.
* **Autonomous Hedge Funds:** Enabling agent-led trading desks to settle complex multi-variable positions without centralized clearinghouse delay.
* **Agentic Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Automating the payout for performance-based contracts between AI agents.

## 2. Distribution & Growth Channels
Our growth strategy leverages the decentralized nature of the "Agentic Web" and the existing Bittensor technical ecosystem.

### Protocol-Level Integration
* **Subnet Alliances:** Directly partnering with subnet owners to embed NASH manifolds as the default settlement protocol for inter-subnet resource exchange.
* **Agentic Liquidity Hubs:** Positioning NASH as the settlement backend for autonomous trading guilds and decentralized compute marketplaces.

### Developer & Integration Flywheels
* **The NASH SDK:** Providing a "plug-and-play" Python library for other subnet owners to integrate NASH manifolds into their existing Synapse communication protocols.
* **Open-Source Contribution:** Releasing modular components of the manifold geometry math to encourage community-driven improvements and broad adoption across the metagraph.

## 3. Incentives for Early Participation
Bootstrapping a settlement layer requires high initial liquidity and verification reliability.

### Bootstrapping Miners: The "Alpha" Advantage
* **Early Emission Multipliers:** In the first phase of the mainnet, miners who hit the **50ms TWF Gold Standard** will receive a boosted "Molt Multiplier" to reward early infrastructure hardening.
* **Hardware Benchmarking:** Providing optimized CUDA kernels and performance benchmarks for miners who demonstrate consistent high-fidelity manifold generation.

### Bootstrapping Validators: Stake-Gated Rewards
* **Dynamic TAO (dTAO) Incentives:** Early validators will be eligible for a specialized weight-distribution pool, rewarding those who successfully identify and support high-fidelity miners during the subnet's infancy.
* **Protocol Governance:** Early participants will have weighted influence in defining the future parameters of the Nash Efficiency Ratio ($R$) and the Proof of Economic Fidelity (PoEF) standards.

### Bootstrapping Users (Agents): Efficiency Incentives
* **The "Liquidity Gateway" Program:** For the first 1,000,000 settled transactions, NASH will waive protocol fees, allowing AI agents to migrate to NASH manifolds with zero overhead.
